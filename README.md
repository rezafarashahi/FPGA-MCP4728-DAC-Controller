# FPGA-MCP4728-DAC-Controller
This project involves configuring the MCP4728A0T-E/UN microchip using an FPGA. The MCP4728 is a 12-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) with 4 channels, configurable via the I2C communication protocol. The project also utilizes UART to communicate between the FPGA and a Python script that generates and sends voltage values to the FPGA.
